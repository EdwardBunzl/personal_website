    <h1>Build great solutions, with peace of mind</h1>
    <p>With 10+ years of consulting experiences I've developped a wide range of skills. Getting to know new clients and sharing my knowledge with them has become a passion. I allways aim for robust solution that are also lean, technical implementations become too often technical debt. Here are some examples of what I can bring you, feel free to contact me if you recognize any of your challenges.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Analytics implementation audit audit.</b> Website & app tracking have been around for years now with added complexity, especially since the implementation of cookie banners and the latests requirements pushed by editors (e.g. consent mode). You might want to have fresh eyes check if your implementation follows the best practices.</p>
    <p><b>One shot implementations / migrations.</b> You might have a concrete problem / project and lack the manpower to tackle it. I can help by reviewing the topic with you, proposing some variations and assuring the implementation</p>
    <p><b>Tooling strategy / PoC.</b> A lot of solutions are out there to help you make the best out of your data : visualization, heatmap & UX analysis, AB testing etc... They also come at a financial cost and need to be maintained by skilled ressources. Consequently good tools do not allways make sense to have right now and can cause more technical debt than anything else. I help you identify which tools make the more sense given your current organization and a roadmap of the future</p>
    <p><b>Datalake setup.</b> I've been working for several years on putting into place Datalakes and organising the data ingestion, transformation and transfer / exchanges, mainly on BigQuery. If you've got a need here I'm sure I can help.</p>
    <p><b>Transition management.</b> With 10+ years of consulting behind me I've been managing teams both in my companies and my clients. Having known different worlds (IT, data, BI, dev, ...) and with good people skills I'm very eager to address transition roles to help you setup the right organisation for a fresh start.</p>
